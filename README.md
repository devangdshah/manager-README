About me ! Devang Shah
- What is this? This page provides info on what to expect if I am your leader. This is not an extensive list by any means but this provides enough information about my management style.

- About Me / My Job — What are some common things people might like to know about you. Some people’s are more personal than others. If you want to get to know your team’s personal lives then start off by sharing yours.

- Personal Principles / Values — What are your default assumptions about people and their intentions? What mindsets do you have and which do you hope other people adopt when working together on the team? What things trigger you?

- 1:1s(One-on-Ones) — What style of 1:1s do you want out of your team? Most above follow the weekly/bi-weekly, 30 min cadence, and the employee controls the agenda.

**Importance**: 1:1 are super important to me as it dedicated time slot for us to talk on anything and everythign which YOU want to talk. Its about you and not about me ! 

**Flexible:** We can change and shif the schedule as needed. If you prefere walk and talk 1:1 during sunny day or over coffee or in office conference room or move to some other time! I am cool with whatever option works best for you.  

**Its not:** These meetngs are not a status report meetings unless you want to talk on this about some important project

For any pressing needs, do not wait for 1:1 

**Give and Take(Feedback):** Feebdack is important for continuous improvement/learning.

**Changes**: Which can directly impact you



- Feedback (how to give & how you give) — What type of feedback do you want? Are you comfortable with people being blunt with you? How do you prefer to give feedback? How do you expect your team to react to feedback?

- How to interpret my calendar — Sometimes a manager’s calendar can be packed. Almost every manager above wants their team to know that they are the most important part of their job, so they’re explicit in saying so. Message them on slack if you need to talk. They’ll make time.

Many also include the following:

- Personal performance scales — If an employee asks, “Where do I stand?” How will you respond? Most seem to do Red/Orange/Green. While Green and Red are clear indicators, orange can open to interpretation. What does that mean and how do you intend for people to react?

- D.R.I. Principle — Not everyone is a believer in Directly Responsible Individual principle, but if you are it can be very powerful. First, though, you need to set the expectation that they take that responsibly.
Done? Ship it!

How? Consensus from the authors I’ve talked to seems to be:

1. The most effective way to deliver the document is to take employees through it in a 1:1.

2. Easiest time to start is during an employee’s on-boarding. Their on-boarding or your own (if you’re inheriting a team)
You made it to the end!
